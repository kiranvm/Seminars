\chapter{Introduction}
The topic of Cloud Computing is gaining more and more
attention in the service research community. The main idea is
to make applications available on flexible execution
environments primarily located in the Internet. Several
flavours are known, and three important ones are depicted in
the Figure 1.1 .

Infrastructure as a service refers to the sharing of
hardware resources for executing services, typically using
virtualization technology. With this so-called Infrastructure
as a Service (IaaS) approach, potentially multiple users use
existing resources. The resources can easily be scaled up
when demand increases, and are typically charged for on a
per-pay-use basis. In the Platform as a Service (PaaS)
approach, the offering also includes a software execution
environment, such as an application server. In the Software
as a Service approach (SaaS), complete applications are
hosted on the Internet so that e.g. your word processing
software isnâ€™t installed locally on your PC anymore but runs
on a server in the network and is accessed through a web
browser.

At the same time, the networking research community is
working on exploring the benefits arising from the new
paradigm of content-centric or information-centric
networking. Traditional networking architectures for the
PSTN and the Internet solve the problem of connecting
terminals or hosts in order to support a specific application
such as telephony or WWW. To this end, traditional naming
and addressing schemes employ box- or domain-oriented
identities such as E.164 numbers for telephony, or IP
addresses and URLs for the Internet. However, the end user
is typically interested in reaching a destination object that
sits behind or in the host, such as a human being or a file,
rather than communicating with the host itself. As the
destination objects move to new hosts, the host- or network-dependent identities of these objects must be updated.
Information-centric networking provides a solution to these
issues by directly addressing the information objects instead
of using the host-dependent or domain-dependent addressing
schemes.
