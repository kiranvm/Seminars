\abstract {\OnePageChapter % one page only ??
Cloud computing is making it possible to separate
the process of building an infrastructure for service
provisioning from the business of providing end user services.
Today, such infrastructures are normally provided in large
data centres and the applications are executed remotely from
the users. One reason for this is that cloud computing requires
a reasonably stable infrastructure and networking
environment, largely due to management reasons. Networking
of Information (NetInf) is an information centric networking
paradigm that can support cloud computing by providing new
possibilities for network transport and storage. It offers direct
access to information objects through a simple API,
independent of their location in the network. This abstraction
can hide much of the complexity of storage and network
transport systems that cloud computing today has to deal with.
In this paper we analyze how cloud computing and NetInf can
be combined to make cloud computing infrastructures easier to
manage, and potentially enable deployment in smaller and
more dynamic networking environments. NetInf should thus
be understood as an enhancement to the infrastructure for
cloud computing rather than a change to cloud computing
technology as such. To illustrate the approach taken by NetInf,
we also describe how it can be implemented by introducing a
specific name resolution and routing mechanism.
