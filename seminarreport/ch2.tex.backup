\section{Definition of Near-Duplicate}

The central idea of near-duplicate spam detection is to exploit
reported known spams to block subsequent ones which have
similar content. For different forms of e-mail representation,
the definitions of similarity between two e-mails are diverse.
Unlike most prior works representing e-mails based mainly
on content text, we investigate representing each e-mail
using an HTML tag sequence, which depicts the layout
structure of e-mail, and look forward to more effectively
capturing the near-duplicate phenomenon of spams. Definition of anchor tag is given as follows:

\textbf \{Definition\} (anchor). The tag \{ anchor \} is one type of
newly defined tag that records the domain name or the e-mail
address in an anchor tag.

For example, the anchor tag \{a href=“http://arbor.ee.
ntu.edu.tw/index.htm”\} is transformed to \{arbor.ee.ntu.
edu.tw\}. The anchor tag \{a href=“mailto:cytseng@arbor.
ee.ntu.edu.tw”\} is transformed to \{cytseng@arbor.ee.
ntu.edu.tw\}. The purpose of creating the (anchor) tag is
to minimize the false positive rate when the number of tags
in an e-mail abstraction is short. The less the number of tags
in an e-mail abstraction, the more possible that a ham may
be matched with known spams and be misclassified as a
spam. Therefore, when the number of tags in an e-mail
abstraction is smaller than a predefined threshold, for each
anchor tag (a), we specifically record the targeted domain
name or e-mail address, which is a significant clue for
identifying spams.
