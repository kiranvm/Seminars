\chapter{Performance Evaluation}
To assess the feasibility of system Cosdes, we conduct several
experiments to explore its efficiency and detection results.
The real spam data sets used in the experiments are from the
e-mail servers of Computer Center in National Taiwan
University, which has over 30,000 students. Since the ground
truth of real e-mail streams is unavailable, spams are
extracted from the well-known existing system, SpamAssassin.3 Concerning hams, we not only include public data sets
(around 4,000 e-mails) provided by SpamAssassin,4 but also
obtain from volunteers. There are about 60,000 spams per day
and a set of 7,000 or so hams in the data set. Note that
numerous related works have evaluated the proposed
methods with static databases. However, to access the
performance of spam detection system with near-duplicate
matching scheme, real e-mail streams are more appropriate
than static data sets. Therefore, in this paper, we use
university-scale e-mail streams as the experimental data sets
to better simulate the e-mail environment.

The processes of
generating each digest in Digest and MultiDigest are
identical. Although Sarafijanovic’s work claims that using
multiple digests can enhance the robustness of near-duplicate
spam detection system, these two works have not been
validated by real e-mail streams. Besides, Yoshida’s work
considers maintaining a direct-mapped cache to facilitate the
process of matching. In the experiments of his work, there
are 10 million spams in the database and 10 percent of hash
values are copied in the cache. However, to fairly compare the
detection performance, the cache mechanism of Yoshida’s
work is not included in our experiments, meaning that all
spams in the database are used for detection.
